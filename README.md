This repository contains a comprehensive framework for an AI-powered cryptocurrency trading system that leverages cutting-edge machine learning and reinforcement learning (RL) techniques. The system integrates advanced technical indicators, sentiment analysis, and whale behavior tracking to make informed trading decisions. It incorporates financial theories like Value at Risk (VaR), modern portfolio theory (MPT), Bayesian inference, and real-time liquidity tracking to support sophisticated risk management and portfolio optimization.
